# OpenFoamFieldJoint

This is a work in progress to be able to model the cool down characteristics of
an insulated pipeline using OpenFoam in an axisymmetric model.

This initial case study is to learn the following:
1. Generate a blockmesh file with wedge and curve geometry             -  Completed
2. Generate the correct system files (fvSchemes and fvSolution files)  -  Work in progress
3. Generate the correct material property files etc.                   -  Work in progress
4. Generate the plot schemes to measure convergence                    -  Not started
5. Generate the post processing results to show key temperatures       -  Not started
